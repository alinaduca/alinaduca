### Hi there 👋

🔭 Not because a recruiter will see it, not even because it will help me in uni, but because there is a student who will actually appreciate it and will use a repo for one of his homeworks.

📫 I really hope you'll find here your answers, but if not, or if something doesn't make any sense, feel free to contact me here: [Messenger](https://www.facebook.com/messages/t/100003166095895).

🏫 FII, UAIC
